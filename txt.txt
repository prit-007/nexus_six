Total: =3.50 + 7.80 
 
✅ Live Calculation Engine 
   Detect and evaluate math expressions on the fly 
   Auto-recalculate when any number is changed 
   Support for referencing previous line results (like @1, @2 for line numbers) 
✅ Editable History

   Inline functions: sum(), avg(), min(), max() 
✅ Variables & References 
   Use variables like tax = 0.1 and reuse: price * (1 + tax) 
   Line reference: @1 + @2

🧾 Example 1: Daily Expense Calculation 
Coffee: 3.50 Lunch: 8.20 Snacks: 2.30 
Total: =3.50 + 8.20 + 2.30 
👉 Output: 
Total: 14.00 
 
💼 Example 2: Project Estimate 
Design: 20 hours x $30 = 600 Development: 50 hours x $40 = 2000 QA: 15 hours x $25 = 375 Total Cost: =600 + 2000 + 375 
👉 Output: 
Total Cost: 2975 
 
🧮 Example 3: Using Variables 
rate = 45 hours = 36 tax = 0.10 
Base Cost: =rate * hours Tax Amount: =Base Cost * tax Total: =Base Cost + Tax Amount 
👉 Output: 
Base Cost: 1620   Tax Amount: 162   Total: 1782 
 
📊 Example 4: Monthly Budget Tracker 
Rent: 950 Groceries: 300 Utilities: 150 Transportation: 120 Miscellaneous: 100 Monthly Expenses: =sum(950, 300, 150, 120, 100) 
👉 Output: 
Monthly Expenses: 1620 
 
🔢 Example 5: Referencing Previous Lines 
1. Item A: 150   2. Item B: 220   3. Subtotal: =@1 + @2 4. Discount (10%): =@3 * 0.1 5. Final Price: =@3 - @4 
👉 Output: 
3. Subtotal: 370   4. Discount (10%): 37   5. Final Price: 333
